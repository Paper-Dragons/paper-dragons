# About this business

This website sells different types of paper dragons, which are tropical, winter, summer, autumn, spring, water and fire designs + mini dragons! These won't be the only designs though, we will eventually introduce more designs. Note that you can only buy a paper dragon if you meet the following requirments:

- You and Mia are in the same school
- You and Mia know each other in real life and can meet to get the paper draagon

These are the basic requirments you need to have before you can get a paper dragon. If you are concerned or confused or have a question about this feel free to contact us [here](https://paperdragons.pages.dev/contact-us/).
